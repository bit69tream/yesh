# yesh
**yesh** is my answer to unix shells (not that anybody asked). I wouldn't even call it a shell, it's a repl at most.

If you want a point of reference - it is most similar to `rc` from Plan9 or [eshell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html "eshell") from Emacs.

## State of the project
Right now this is nothing more than a proof of concept. Unfinished, unpolished and soon to be forgotten.
